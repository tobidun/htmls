    <h1 style="color: black; font-size: 30px">Our story so far</h1>
    <p>
      Our story began in 2001 when e4education was founded by John Roach. Having
      built websites for a few schools, he quickly realised that schools had a
      unique requirement so his small team set about developing a Content
      Management System for the education sector. As the functionality grew, so
      did the customer base and the team supporting them. In April 2021,
      e4education celebrated 20 years in business and had over 40 staff and
      2,500 customers. In November 2021, e4education was acquired by Juniper
      Education. Juniper is the only provider in the UK which has all the
      software solutions schools and trusts need under one roof. The e4education
      offering compliments the Juniper portfolio perfectly and customers can
      enjoy the benefit of the expanded service offering.
